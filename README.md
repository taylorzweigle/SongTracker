# Song Tracker

Simple project to practice creating a MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS) web application. The app is centered around a data table listing out songs learned and to be learned on the guitar. This table is filterable in three ways:

1.	Filter by completion (Total Songs, Completed Songs, and ToDo Songs)
2.	Filter by guitar tuning (All, Standard, Drop D, Eb, Drop Db)
3.	Filter/search by song, artist, or album name

Songs can be added to the database via a form, and can be edited or deleted. As songs are learned, they can be checked off for completion.
